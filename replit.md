# Overview

This is a comprehensive full-stack sleep optimization platform built with React and Express. The application provides multiple scientifically-based calculators to help users optimize their sleep cycles using 90-minute REM cycle science. It features an advanced SEO-optimized design with smooth animations, multiple calculator modes (bedtime, wake-up, nap, sleep tracking, age-specific), and educational content to rank highly on Google for sleep-related searches.

## Recent Enhancements (January 2025)
- Added comprehensive SEO optimization targeting high-value keywords like "sleep calculator", "90 minute sleep cycle calculator", "nap calculator"
- Implemented 5 distinct calculator modes with smooth animations and transitions
- Created advanced sleep tracking and analysis features
- Added age-specific sleep recommendations with scientific backing
- Enhanced UI with gradient backgrounds, glassmorphism effects, and micro-animations
- Integrated FAQ section and educational content optimized for search engines
- Implemented structured data markup for better search visibility

# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state, TanStack Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized production builds

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Server Setup**: Custom Vite middleware integration for development
- **Storage**: In-memory storage implementation with interface for future database integration
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints with `/api` prefix
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error middleware with proper HTTP status codes

## Data Storage Solutions
- **Current**: In-memory storage using Map data structures
- **Database Ready**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL with schema definitions
- **Schema**: User table with username/password fields and UUID primary keys
- **Migrations**: Drizzle-kit setup for database schema management

## Authentication and Authorization
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage
- **User Model**: Basic user schema with username and password fields
- **Storage Interface**: Abstracted storage layer supporting user CRUD operations

## External Dependencies
- **Database**: Neon serverless PostgreSQL (configured but not actively used)
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI for accessible component primitives
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod resolvers for validation
- **Date Utilities**: date-fns for time calculations and formatting
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography
- **Development**: Replit-specific plugins for runtime error handling and cartographer integration

The architecture follows a monorepo structure with clear separation between client, server, and shared code. The sleep calculation logic is implemented as pure functions that calculate optimal sleep times based on 90-minute sleep cycles, accounting for a 15-minute fall-asleep period.
