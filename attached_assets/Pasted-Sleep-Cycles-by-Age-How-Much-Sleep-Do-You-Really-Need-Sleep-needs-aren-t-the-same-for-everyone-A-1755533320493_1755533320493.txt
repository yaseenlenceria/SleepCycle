Sleep Cycles by Age: How Much Sleep Do You Really Need?

Sleep needs aren’t the same for everyone. A newborn’s sleep looks very different from a teenager’s or a senior’s. That’s because our sleep cycles—and how many hours we need—change as we age.

According to the CDC and NHS, the recommended amount of sleep varies by age group. Let’s break it down so you know exactly how much sleep you (or your child) really need.

What Is a Sleep Cycle?

A sleep cycle is a 90-minute rhythm made up of:

Light sleep (stages 1 & 2) – transition and early rest

Deep sleep (stage 3) – physical recovery and repair

REM sleep (stage 4) – dreaming, learning, and memory consolidation

Most adults need 4–6 cycles per night, while babies and children need more frequent, shorter cycles.

Sleep Needs by Age (NHS & CDC Recommendations)

Here’s a clear breakdown of how much sleep different age groups need:

Age Group	Recommended Sleep (per 24 hrs)	Typical Cycles per Night	Notes
Newborns (0–3 mo)	14–17 hours	8–9 cycles (short naps)	Sleep is spread across day & night
Infants (4–12 mo)	12–16 hours (incl. naps)	7–8 cycles	Regular night sleep + daytime naps
Toddlers (1–2 yrs)	11–14 hours (incl. naps)	6–7 cycles	Need consistent bedtime routines
Children (3–5 yrs)	10–13 hours	6–7 cycles	Sleep consolidates at night
School-age (6–12 yrs)	9–12 hours	5–6 cycles	Important for learning & growth
Teenagers (13–18 yrs)	8–10 hours	5–6 cycles	Teens often go to bed later, creating sleep debt
Adults (18–64 yrs)	7–9 hours	4–6 cycles	Most adults feel best with 7.5 hours (5 cycles)
Older Adults (65+ yrs)	7–8 hours	4–5 cycles	Sleep may be lighter, with earlier wake times

Why Sleep Needs Change With Age

Babies: Spend more time in REM sleep, essential for brain development.

Kids: Need longer deep sleep for physical growth and learning.

Teenagers: Body clocks shift, making them naturally “night owls.”

Adults: Stabilize at around 7–9 hours with consistent cycles.

Seniors: Sleep becomes lighter and may include more nighttime waking.

How to Plan Sleep Better

Knowing how much sleep you need is only part of the solution. The real secret to waking up refreshed is aligning with your sleep cycles.
