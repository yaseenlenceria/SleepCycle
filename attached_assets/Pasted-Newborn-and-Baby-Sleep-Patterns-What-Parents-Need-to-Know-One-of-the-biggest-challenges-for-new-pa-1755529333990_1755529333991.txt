Newborn and Baby Sleep Patterns: What Parents Need to Know

One of the biggest challenges for new parents is understanding their baby’s sleep. From long naps to night wakings, newborns have very different sleep patterns compared to adults. Knowing what’s normal and what to expect at each stage can give you peace of mind and help your baby get the rest they need.

In this guide, we’ll cover:

How long newborns sleep each day

Newborn sleep patterns by week and by month

How sleep changes as babies grow

When to feed your baby during the night

Signs your newborn may be sleeping too much

How Much Do Newborns Sleep?

It’s normal for newborns to sleep a lot. In fact, newborns can sleep up to 22 hours a day during their first weeks of life. Their sleep is spread out in short bursts of 2–4 hours because their tiny stomachs need frequent feeding.

So if your baby seems to sleep “all day,” don’t worry — it’s a normal part of development.

Newborn Sleep Patterns by Week

Week 1–2: Babies may sleep 18–22 hours a day, waking mainly for feeding.

Week 3–4: Sleep becomes slightly more predictable, though still broken into 2–3 hour stretches.

Week 5–6: Some babies begin to have one slightly longer sleep (4–5 hours) at night, but daytime naps are frequent.

Baby Sleep Patterns by Month

As your baby grows, their sleep gradually consolidates into longer stretches.

0–2 months: 16–20 hours of sleep daily, in short cycles.

3–4 months: 14–16 hours a day. Some babies begin sleeping 5–6 hours at night.

6 months: Around 14 hours a day, with longer night sleep and 2–3 daytime naps.

9–12 months: Around 12–14 hours a day. Many babies can sleep through the night with one or two naps.

Newborn Sleep Cycle (NHS Guidance)

According to the NHS, newborns don’t have the same structured sleep cycles as adults. They move between light sleep (active sleep) and deep sleep (quiet sleep). Each cycle lasts about 50 minutes.

That’s why newborns wake frequently — it’s completely normal and not a sign something is wrong.

How Long Should a Newborn Sleep Without Feeding?

In the first weeks, babies should not go longer than 3–4 hours without feeding, even at night. Their stomachs are small, and they need frequent feeds for healthy growth.

After the first month, some babies may sleep for 5–6 hours at a time, but always follow your doctor’s advice.

Is My Newborn Sleeping Too Much?

Most of the time, even very long sleep stretches are normal. However, contact your pediatrician if:

Your baby consistently sleeps more than 22 hours a day

They’re very difficult to wake for feeding

They show signs of illness (fever, poor feeding, lethargy)

What If My Newborn Slept 7 Hours Without Feeding?

It’s not uncommon for a newborn to occasionally sleep for a longer stretch, especially at night. But in the first weeks, babies need regular feeds. If your baby sleeps longer than 6–7 hours in the early weeks, it’s usually best to wake them for a feed, unless your pediatrician has advised otherwise.

Key Takeaways

Newborns can sleep up to 22 hours a day.

Sleep happens in short bursts of 2–4 hours, especially in the first month.

By month 3–4, babies start to sleep longer stretches.

The NHS explains newborn sleep cycles last around 50 minutes.

Babies should be fed every 2–4 hours in the early weeks.

Always check with a doctor if your baby is excessively sleepy or hard to wake.

Conclusion

Every baby is different, but understanding newborn sleep patterns by week and month can help you know what’s normal. Newborns need a lot of rest and frequent feeding, and sleep gradually becomes more structured as they grow.

If you’re unsure about your baby’s sleep needs, follow NHS guidance and talk to your pediatrician for reassurance.
