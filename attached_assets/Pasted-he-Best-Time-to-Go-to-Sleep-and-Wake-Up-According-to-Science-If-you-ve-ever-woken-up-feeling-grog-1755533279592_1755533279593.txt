he Best Time to Go to Sleep and Wake Up (According to Science)

If you‚Äôve ever woken up feeling groggy even after a ‚Äúfull night‚Äôs sleep,‚Äù you‚Äôre not alone. The problem isn‚Äôt always how many hours you sleep‚Äîit‚Äôs often when you go to bed and wake up.

Science shows that sleep happens in 90-minute cycles, and waking up at the end of a cycle makes you feel refreshed. Waking up in the middle of deep sleep, on the other hand, leaves you tired and foggy.

So, what‚Äôs the best time to sleep and wake up? Let‚Äôs break it down.

Why the 90-Minute Sleep Cycle Matters

Each cycle has stages:

Light sleep (dozing off)

Deep sleep (physical restoration)

REM sleep (dreaming and brain recovery)

A full cycle lasts about 90 minutes. Adults usually need 5‚Äì6 cycles per night (7.5‚Äì9 hours) for optimal health and energy.

The trick is to plan your bedtime around your wake-up time, so you‚Äôre not waking in the middle of deep sleep.

Best Bedtimes for Common Wake-Up Times

Here‚Äôs a quick reference table showing the best bedtimes if you want to wake up feeling energized.

Wake-Up Time	4 Cycles (6 hrs)	5 Cycles (7.5 hrs)	6 Cycles (9 hrs)
6:00 AM	12:00 AM	10:30 PM	9:00 PM
7:00 AM	1:00 AM	11:30 PM	10:00 PM
8:00 AM	2:00 AM	12:30 AM	11:00 PM

üí° Tip: Most adults function best with 5 cycles (about 7.5 hours) of sleep.

What Time Should I Go to Bed?

The best time to go to bed depends on when you want to wake up. For example:

If you want to wake up at 6 AM, aim to be asleep by 10:30 PM.

If you need to wake up at 7 AM, the sweet spot is around 11:30 PM.

If you can wake up at 8 AM, then 12:30 AM is ideal.

This way, you‚Äôll complete a full cycle and wake up naturally refreshed.
