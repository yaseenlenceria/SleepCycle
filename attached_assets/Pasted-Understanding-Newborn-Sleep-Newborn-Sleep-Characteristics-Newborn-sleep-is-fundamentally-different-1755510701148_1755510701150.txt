Understanding Newborn Sleep
Newborn Sleep Characteristics
Newborn sleep is fundamentally different from adult sleep. Understanding these unique patterns helps set realistic expectations and promotes better sleep for the whole family.

Active Sleep (REM)
• 50% of total sleep time
• Rapid eye movements
• Facial expressions and sounds
• Light sleep - easily awakened
• Critical for brain development
Quiet Sleep (NREM)
• 50% of total sleep time
• Still body and regular breathing
• Deeper sleep state
• Physical growth and repair
• Harder to wake from

Week-by-Week Newborn Sleep Development
0-2 Weeks: Adjustment Period
• Sleep 16-20 hours per day
• Wake every 1-3 hours for feeding
• No predictable patterns
• Day/night confusion common
3-6 Weeks: Emerging Patterns
• Sleep 15-18 hours per day
• Slightly longer wake periods
• Begin to show preferences
• Fussy periods may emerge
6-12 Weeks: Growing Awareness
• Sleep 14-16 hours per day
• Longer stretches of 3-4 hours
• More alert during wake times
• Beginning of day/night distinction
Common Newborn Sleep Concerns
Day/Night Confusion
Newborns don't have established circadian rhythms.

Help: Bright light during day feeds, dim lights at night, keep nighttime interactions quiet and boring.

Catnapping
Very short naps (20-30 minutes) are normal for newborns.

Normal: Newborn sleep cycles are shorter. Longer naps develop around 3-4 months.

Noisy Sleep
Grunting, sighing, and movement during sleep is normal.

When to check: Only if crying or appears distressed. Light movements and sounds are typical.

Frequently Asked Questions
How often should my newborn sleep?
Newborns sleep 14-17 hours per day in short stretches of 2-4 hours. They typically wake every 2-3 hours to feed, even at night.

Is it safe for newborns to sleep on their side?
No, always place newborns on their back to sleep. Side sleeping increases SIDS risk as babies can roll to their stomach.

When will my newborn sleep through the night?
Most babies don't sleep through the night until 4-6 months. Newborns need frequent feedings and haven't developed mature sleep patterns yet.

Should I wake my newborn to feed?
Yes, if your newborn hasn't eaten in 4-5 hours during the day or is losing weight. Consult your pediatrician for specific guidance.
