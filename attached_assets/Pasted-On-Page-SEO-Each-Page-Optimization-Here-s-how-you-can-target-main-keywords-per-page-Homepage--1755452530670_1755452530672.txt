4. Content & Blog Strategy

Google loves blogs with fresh content.
Create 1–2 posts weekly targeting long-tail keywords:

“AI sleep calculator vs traditional sleep calculators”

“How many sleep cycles do I need for X age?”

“Best bedtime according to AI (2025 Guide)”

“Why 90-minute sleep cycles matter – backed by science”

👉 Link each blog to your calculators & homepage.

5. Off-Page SEO (Aggressive Link Building)

Submit to AI tool directories (there are hundreds of “Best AI Tools” blogs).

Post on Reddit & Quora (answers like: “How to fix my sleep cycle?” → link your tool).

Do guest posts in health & wellness blogs.

Build backlinks with HARO (Help A Reporter Out).

6. User Engagement & Social Proof

Add “AI Fixed My Sleep” testimonials (even early users/friends).

Create Twitter & TikTok clips showing how your AI recommends personalized sleep schedules.

Run free challenges → “Fix your sleep in 7 days with AI (try Sleepcycle.io)”.

7. Aggressive Messaging (AI First)

On every page, use power phrases:

“Not just another calculator – AI that adapts to YOU.”

“Science-backed, AI-driven, personalized to your body.”

“The only tool that doesn’t just calculate – it fixes your sleep.”
